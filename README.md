# Flashfeed-News-App
This project introduces FlashFeed, a mobile news app that compiles real-time articles via the GNews API and offers accessibility with Text-to-Speech (TTS). The app features an auto-dark mode, along with a share button for effortless content sharing. 

Features

•	News Aggregation: The application collects the most recent news from multiple trustworthy sources using the GNews API, keeping users informed with the latest updates. 

•	Text-to-Speech (TTS): This feature allows users to listen to news articles, making the content more accessible for visually impaired users or those who favor audio formats.

•	Dark Mode: This mode activates automatically depending on the surrounding light, allowing users to read comfortably in dimly lit settings. 

•	Share Button: This feature facilitates the easy sharing of news articles through social media or messaging platforms, boosting user engagement and interaction with the app.

User Experience Design and Considerations
Flashfeed's user interface is intuitive and simple. The main screen provides a news feed with the latest articles, orderly layouts, to ensure easy navigation between news categories. TTS is easy to use and allows users to easily switch between reading and listening. The dark mode of the app provides the most optimal visual comfort in a typical user interface, especially in nighttime use and poor lighting conditions.


CONCLUSION 

FlashFeed combines current news aggregation with text-to-speech technology (TTS) to provide a comprehensive platform for user visual impairment, multitaskers and audio content. Gnews displays visually and voice representation based on API and internal TTS technology. Adds an automatic dark mode when the ambient light sensor reaches a certain level and the possibility of sharing messages, convenience and commitment is added. With support from UN SDG 4 for high quality education and SDG 10 to reduce inequality, we plan to quickly arrange digital inclusiveness for flash feeds, as well as majority feeds, user connections, and offline playback.
